Changes in 1.1.0 (2017-07-24)
 * Fixed broken MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD support (#86523)
   The functionality wasn't correctly updated when the entrypoint script was
   changed to only create the root@localhost user by default
 * Changed control files to be generated from a common template
   The control files for each version will be generated by swapping out the few
   commands that differ between server versions
 * Made PACKAGE_URL an ARG entry, to allow build-time changing
   The URL variables can be changed by supplying new ones with --build-arg at
   build time
 * Added basic healthcheck script
   Once database init is complete a flag file will be touched. If this file
   exists and mysqladmin ping succeeds, the container is reported as healthy,
   meaning it is ready for use
 * Database init will now use configured socket setting instead of hardcoded
   Using a hardcoded socket could cause init scripts to fail in confusing ways
   if the user customized the socket setting
 * Added MySQL Shell to supported images
   For 5.7 and 8.0, MySQL Shell is installed together with the server.

Known issues:
 * For existing databases created with older images/not with Docker, the
   healthcheck script will generate an "Access denied for healthchecker@localhost"
   message in the server log every time it runs. If connection throttling is
   enabled this could eventually cause the healthcheck to fail
 * 5.7: Shell 1.0.9 is unable to set up innodb-cluster with the default
   root@localhost user (#86267)
